  - nagyo-worker will pull Host/node info from nventory
  - user will manually enter the hostgroups
    - when nagyo-worker runs, it will update any existing nagyo-server 
      hostgroups with host members from nventory

  - get nagyo-worker running on nagios1.dc1
    - use 1.8.7 for now (nv_helpers already installed in system lib)
    - gem "nventory-client"
    - nv_helpers into a gem?
      - in nagios1.dc1:/tmp/nv_helpers
      - pat will cleanup and add to github
        - need to remove eharmony specific text, config etc
      - 

  - Feature Request: take a contact and traverse the associations 
    pulling all services/hosts/etc that contact would be alerted for 

  - write up a doc on order of operations for creating .... e.g. Contact 
    or other optimal flows

  - can continue customizing rails_admin edit pages:
    - optional vs required sections?  hide/close?


Done
----

  x fix application_helper nagios_options_from_array

  x Devise auth: 
      x anyone can show action
      x only logged in Users can update/create records

  x nodegroup === hostgroup ...
    (nventory)    (nagios)

  x fix the Show action to reconvert associated-ids into nagios strings
    - use Extensions::DereferencedJson

  x refactor: merge Vip into Cluster model to simplify/dry it up

  x look into active-admin-mongoid?
     - uses older mongoid 2.x

  x try out bootstrap if we keep our own templates/html

  x BOH Feature: add a warning message when deleting objects to show 
    what the dependent object chain destruction would do 
    - resolution: rails-admin has this feature

  x finish replacing *_name fields with method or field generated from 
    data
     - e.g. Service.host_name will come from Service.host.host_name 

  x convert old string defaults (e.g. "24x7") into association defaults
    - made a set_defaults method on a few models

  x convert app to rails_admin (works with mongoid)
     x install rails_admin and config
     x convert the nagios options to multi-select, 
       x provide Extensions::SerializedNagiosOptions with serialize_nagios_options helper

  x modify routes to support old json show path
    x remount rails_admin from /admin to => /

  x allow anyone to show/list objects but only require login for edits
    - was a regression issue after rails_admin integration

  x fix bug in nagios options when value is not set yet - tries to split nil
