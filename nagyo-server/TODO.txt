  - Devise auth: 
      - anyone can show action
      - only logged in Users can update/create records

  - nodegroup === hostgroup ...
    (nventory)    (nagios)

  - fix the Show action to reconvert associated-ids into nagios strings

  - take a contact and traverse the associations pulling all 
    services/hosts/etc that contact would be alerted for 

  - add a warning message when deleting objects to show what the 
    dependent object chain destruction would do 

  - merge Vip into Cluster model to simplify/dry it up

  - fix up index pages to show object association strings instead of 
    object ids: http://0.0.0.0:3000/contacts

  - fix application_helper nagios_options_from_array

  - write up a doc on order of operations for creating .... e.g. Contact 
    or other optimal flows
