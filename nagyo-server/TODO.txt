  - replace misc *_name fields with method or field generated from data
     - e.g. Service.host_name will come from Service.host.host_name 

  - Feature Request: take a contact and traverse the associations 
    pulling all services/hosts/etc that contact would be alerted for 

  - write up a doc on order of operations for creating .... e.g. Contact 
    or other optimal flows

  - rails_admin works with mongoid - do we need it? has below feature
  - BOH Feature: add a warning message when deleting objects to show 
    what the dependent object chain destruction would do 

  - cleanup: fix index pages to show object association strings instead 
    of object ids: http://0.0.0.0:3000/contacts

  - try out bootstrap if we keep our own templates/html
