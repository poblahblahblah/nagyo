  - refactor: merge Vip into Cluster model to simplify/dry it up

  - Feature Request: take a contact and traverse the associations 
    pulling all services/hosts/etc that contact would be alerted for 

  - write up a doc on order of operations for creating .... e.g. Contact 
    or other optimal flows

  - look into active-admin-mongoid?

  - BOH Feature: add a warning message when deleting objects to show 
    what the dependent object chain destruction would do 

  - cleanup: fix index pages to show object association strings instead 
    of object ids: http://0.0.0.0:3000/contacts
