  - finish replacing *_name fields with method or field generated from 
    data
     - e.g. Service.host_name will come from Service.host.host_name 

  - convert old string defaults (e.g. "24x7") into association defaults

  - rails_admin works with mongoid
     x install rails_admin and config
     - convert the nagios options to checkboxes, figure out how to 
       reconvert again (maybe just override attr setter in model helper)
     - edit pages: optional vs required sections? hide/close?

  - Feature Request: take a contact and traverse the associations 
    pulling all services/hosts/etc that contact would be alerted for 

  - write up a doc on order of operations for creating .... e.g. Contact 
    or other optimal flows



Done
----

  x fix application_helper nagios_options_from_array

  x Devise auth: 
      x anyone can show action
      x only logged in Users can update/create records

  x nodegroup === hostgroup ...
    (nventory)    (nagios)

  x fix the Show action to reconvert associated-ids into nagios strings
    - use Extensions::DereferencedJson

  x refactor: merge Vip into Cluster model to simplify/dry it up

  x look into active-admin-mongoid?
     - uses older mongoid 2.x

  x try out bootstrap if we keep our own templates/html

  x BOH Feature: add a warning message when deleting objects to show 
    what the dependent object chain destruction would do 
    - resolution: rails-admin has this feature
